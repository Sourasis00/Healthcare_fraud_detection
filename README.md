Developed a machine learning system to detect fraudulent health insurance claims using real-world style claim attributes. Built a complete end-to-end pipeline including data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Used techniques such as class balancing and model interpretability to improve fraud-catching performance and ensure transparency.

Key Contributions

Processed an enhanced health insurance claims dataset containing demographic, medical, and billing attributes.

Engineered meaningful features such as claim patterns, hospitalization duration, and provider behavior to identify hidden anomalies.

Built a machine learning pipeline using Random Forest and preprocessing steps (scaling + one-hot encoding).

Addressed heavy class imbalance using class weighting, improving the model’s ability to identify rare fraud cases.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.

Saved the trained model to a .pkl file and created a structure for future deployment through an API or Streamlit app.

Designed the project to be easily integrated into real-world healthcare fraud analytics workflows.
